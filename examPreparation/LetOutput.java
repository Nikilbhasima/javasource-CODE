// Derive a class Airplane, having instance variables code, name capacity and methods getData() and putData() (that overrides Fmachine’s getData() and putData()) to read and display the result.
// Create some instances of Airplane and callthe required methods.

//Make an interface named num with two function int add(int x, int y) and int diff(int x, int y) then make a class that implements that interface num.

//Create a class Student with instance variable rollNo and two methods to read and display the rollNo then create another class Test that inherits class Student,
// consisting of its own instance variables to hold the marks of two subjects and also method to read and display the marks.
// Finally create another class Result which inherits class Test. It also has its own instance variable total to hold the total of two marks scored by the student.
// Similarly it has methods to calculate and display the total. Create some instances of above classes and demonstrate inheritance.

//Create an interface which has method getData() and displayArea().
// Create two classes Rectangle and Square which implements this interface.
// Define the instance variable of these classes as per requirement in this class itself.
// Create some instances of Rectangle and Square classes and demonstrate interface implementation by class.
